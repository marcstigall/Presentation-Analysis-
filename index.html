  <p>What made this a great presentation was the visuals and the audio.
    Music was used to create an atmosphere depending on the part of the
    presentation the speaker was doing. I’m an avid nature enthusiast, so
    watching this was not only fun and interesting but informative and
    enlightening on a subject that seems simple but is complex. The speaker
    told a story about his relationship with bees. After studying them he
    concluded that the species faces a lot of problems, but one stood out.
    The simplicity of the subject was appealing and straight to the point.
    Bees face a mite problem, that when they are attached to a bee it sucks
    their blood causing immune deficiency which can destroy a colony. This
    hit home because I love nature and bees are important to our food
    industry. Bringing awareness about something I never heard of drew me
    in to learn a new facet in bee life. Watching this presentation instead
    of just reading showed me firsthand what the mites looked like. 21
    days of the bee’s life was condensed to 60 seconds and I was able to
    see the mites crawling on them as they formed. It was very interesting
    to watch the beginning of their life. He showed a major concern for
    the species by not only bringing forth the awareness of the mite
    problem but also what was being done about it. Treating the mites
    with chemicals deemed not ideal. So, after observations were made
    it was concluded that some bees showed a resistance to the mites.
    The idea of breeding those bees came about. Even still more
    problems arose with this tactic.</p>



  <h2>Where is Cybercrime Really Coming From?</h2>

  <p>The opening is powerful. “Cybercrime is out of control” made me ask
    questions like; what is cybercrime? How exactly is it out of control?
    Technology has always interested me, especially software development.
    Hearing someone talk about how bad guys are using software to infiltrate
    systems and steal sensitive data is very interesting. The speaker did a
    great job of explaining the situation and shedding light on where these
    attacks are coming from. The facts itself drew me in. I had
    multiple “I didn’t know that” moments. Me wanting to pursue a career in the
    technology industry showed me that cybercrime is not only real but in
    desperate need for security specialists to fend off these attacks. The
    speaker made aware that 80% of cybercrimes come from criminal gangs.
    These groups collectively have topped out at 445 billion dollars in this
    illegal economy. Me watching this I’m able to feel the seriousness of the
    situation. It’s quite scary to find out that the internet
    can be used in a way to ruin people’s lives financially. The speaker was
    giving the audience a wake-up call. Letting them know not only what
    criminals have done so far but also their capabilities. It was kind of
    humorous at times. Not in a comedic way but in a I can’t believe it kind of
    way. Showing some emails and tactics that criminals use on victims to get
    their information baffles people at how real and sophisticated these attacks
    are. </p>

  <p>This presentation shows the world of robotics and the potential it can
    have on human life. Applications can be applied on earth and in space.
    Robotics is a captivating subject on many different levels. One can think
    of them to improve the human experience. They can also be viewed as our
    evolutionary downfall. The way the presenter delivered the content
    piqued my curiosity. Stating that a robot can only do what it is
    programmed, then painting the picture of a multi-use robot is intriguing.
    I enjoyed the visuals provided during the presentation. I love working
    with my hands. I’ve put together Legos with my family. I’ve also
    programmed software for specific tasks. Stating that any 3D form can
    be made using 2D surfaces lit a bulb in my mind. Math is the language
    of the universe and using these in tandem the possibilities are endless
    on what can be created. Seeing the videos of the origami robots
    operating was fun. Seeing how they move was something I couldn’t get
    from just reading an article. I felt enlightened about the future.
    I could only imagine what is capable of these concepts. It made me
    think about how origami robots could this help people. By providing
    different scenarios, the speaker showed the audience what is
    possible and what problems can be solved with this technology.</p>

  <h1>Qualities and Techniques</h1>
  <h2>The First 21 Days of a Bee's Life</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The technique of using music to create an atmosphere at different points
      in the video was a great way to make me feel what he intended. During the
      60 seconds timelapse it made the view more enjoyable.</li>
    <li>The presenter started the presentation with a story that drew me in.
      He began talking of the bee farm he has in his back yard.
    </li>
    <li>Ending the presentation with a call to action on what happens next was inspiring.
      Stating that to improve the life of the bees we must improve our relationship with them.
    </li>
    <li>Having the right amount of hand gestures and eye contact kept me interested
      and not distracted from the message. I could feel his concern and his seriousness for what he was talking about.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Where is Cybercrime Really Coming From?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>One of the qualities the speaker shown to me was a sense of humor at a
      dark situation. Making me laugh was a great way to keep me interested.
      I thought it was funny that his team encountered a criminal group after
      reviewing their attack software. They received an email from the criminals
      boasting about their new and improved product. </li>
    <li>Hearing that the economy of cybercrime has brought in 445 billion
      dollars blew me away. This fact alone is enough to make me want to learn
      more about the subject. The technique of providing quality facts is a
      wonderful way to make a powerful presentation. </li>
    <li>The speaker’s call to action is a great way to combat cybercrime. He
      suggested sharing information on attacks instead of harboring it. With
      organizations sharing how the attacks happened it can help prevent future
      losses. Thus, making cybercrime not pay.</li>

  </ul>
    <h2>Origami Robots That Reshape and Transform Themselves</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Showing videos of the robots was a very great technique to use on this
         subject. Showing the possibilities and functions of the robots made me
         feel invested in the idea. </li>
      <li>Talking slowly so everyone can absorb the pertinent information was a
        wonderful touch. Robotics can come off as boring to some. Mainly because
         the gap of understanding is too big. She did a great job of emphasizing
          the presentation.</li>
      <li>Having a live demo of one of the robots made me feel engaged. The prop
         was fun and made me investigate it deeper after the presentation.</li>
